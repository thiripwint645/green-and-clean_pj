        Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new
        materials and objects. The recyclability of a material depends on its
        ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state. It is
        an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material
        and help lower greenhouse gas emissions. It can also prevent the waste
        of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw
        materials, reducing energy use, air pollution and water pollution.

        <h2>Conserving natural resources</h2>
        <p>
          The world's natural resources are finite, and some are in very short
          supply. At a fundamental level:
          <span class="color"><q>Recycling paper and wood</q> </span> saves
          trees and forests. Yes, you can plant new trees, but you can't replace
          virgin rainforest or ancient woodlands once they're lost.
          <span class="color"><q>Recycling plastic</q></span> means creating
          less new plastic, which is definitely a good thing, especially as it's
          usually made from fossil fuel hydrocarbons.
          <span class="color"><q>Recycling metals</q></span> means there's less
          need for risky, expensive and damaging mining and extraction of new
          metal ores. <span class="color"><q>Recycling glass</q></span> reduces
          the need to use new raw materials like sand, it sounds hard to
          believe, but supplies of some types of sand are starting to get low
          around the world.

        <h2>Protecting ecosystems and wildlife</h2>
        <p>
          Recycling reduces the need to grow, harvest or extract new raw
          materials from the Earth. That in turn lessens the harmful disruption
          and damage being done to the natural world: fewer forests cut down,
          rivers diverted, wild animals harmed or displaced, and less pollution
          of water, soil and air. And of course if our plastic waste isn't
          safely put in the recycling, it can be blown or washed into rivers and
          seas and end up hundreds or thousands of miles away, polluting
          coastlines and waterways and becoming a problem for everyone.

        <p>
          Instead of tossing away those old bottles of lotion or shampoo, make
          yourself a phone holder for charging. Created from an upcycled bottle,
          this convenient caddy makes it easy to charge your phone at any outlet
          without leaving a trail of wire across the floor. Remember to give it
          your personal touch with some customised d√©cor. Here are the steps to
          make one.

        <h2>Reducing demand for raw materials</h2>
        <p>
          The world's increasing demand for new stuff has led to more of the
          poorest and most vulnerable people (for example, those living around
          forests or river systems) being displaced from their homes, or
          otherwise exploited. Forest communities can find themselves evicted as
          a result of the search for cheap timber and rivers can be damned or
          polluted by manufacturing waste. It's far better to recycle existing
          products than to damage someone else's community or land in the search
          for new raw materials.

        <h2>Vertical Hanging Garden</h2>
        <p>
          Vertical gardens are a great solution to many challenges within urban
          spaces and recycling plastic bottles is a great way to make one for
          yourself. Any number of bottles can be strung together and hung
          against a wall, a fence or a railing to create a garden. Remember to
          choose plastic bottles that are fairly thick and durable, such as soft
          drink bottles, rather than thin water bottles, which may tear under
          the weight of soil, plants and water. Here are some interesting ideas
          for a plastic bottle vertical garden.
